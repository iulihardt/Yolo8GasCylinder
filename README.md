# YOLO8 Gas Cylinder Detection

This repository contains code and resources related to Gas Cylinder Detection using YOLOv8.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop and train a YOLOv8 model to detect gas cylinders in images and videos. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection system that can detect multiple objects in images and videos quickly and accurately.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/iulihardt/Yolo8GasCylinder.git

 

# Yolo8GasCylinder

This project is a demonstration of how to use the YOLOv8 model to detect gas cylinders in images. The project uses a custom dataset of one classes of gas cylinders, which are:

- GLP

The project consists of a Jupyter notebook that shows the steps to train and test the YOLOv8 model using the Darknet framework. The notebook also includes some examples of the model's predictions on new images.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Google Colab or a GPU-enabled machine
- Darknet framework (https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet)
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- YOLO8
- Matplotlib

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project was created by the author and contains 200 images of gas cylinders in different scenarios. The images were labeled using the LabelImg tool (https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) and converted to the YOLO format. The dataset is divided into 160 images for training and 40 images for testing.
